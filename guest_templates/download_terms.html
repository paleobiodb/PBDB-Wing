<p>When you use Paleobiology Database data in publications, we ask that you cite the data in two
ways. First, please cite the database itself and/or the relevant data archive.  If you cite a data
archive, you can use a format like this:

<blockquote>
Alroy, J. 2013.  North American Fossil Mammal Systematics.  Paleobiology Database.
http://paleobiodb.org/classic?page=OSA_3_North_American_mammals.
</blockquote>

<p>We also suggest that you include citations to all of the papers from which data was extracted in
your bibliography, or include a data bibliography as an electronic supplement to your paper. You can
import the data into your reference management software from either the %%filename%%-references.csv file or
the %%filename%%-RIS.txt file to make this process simple for you to exectute.</p>

<p>If your paper relies heavily on Palebiology Database data, you can also request an official PbDb
publication number after the paper is accepted for publication by sending e-mail to
<a href="mailto:sec@paleobiodb.org?subject=PBDB%20publication%20number%20request">sec@paleobiodb.org</a>.
